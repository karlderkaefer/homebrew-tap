# homebrew-tap

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for my personal projects.

## Private Github Repository Release Downloader

This tap provides a formula for a tool that downloads releases from private Github repositories.
It is an example how to handle authentication in a Homebrew formula.
Thanks to [lekkodev](https://github.com/lekkodev) for the original [script](https://github.com/lekkodev/homebrew-lekko/blob/main/lib/custom_download_strategy.rb) idea. This script was slighty modified to improve security by using headers for github token.
